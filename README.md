# Congitional-GAN
Conditional GAN trained to create a car images of size 36x36

* Input dataset is in **"Input_car_train"** path.
* All the code is contained in the Jupyter-notebook file **"cGAN_cars.ipynb"**
* File **"cGAN_cars.py"** is the Jupyter file converted to *\*.py* format
* Path **"tensorboards"** contains all scalars, graphs and histograms presented in **"Report_Orel_1836231.pdf"**
* Path **"out"** contains intermediate training results at every 1000 training steps
* Path **"model_weights"** contains all the model weights for the trained model. This path is not presented here in GitHub, you can find it in my cloud storage: https://yadi.sk/d/-rQfGuyK_gYzEQ
